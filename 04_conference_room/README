This model was created over a period of three weeks by painstaking
measurements and many vi editing sessions.  The real conference room
looks very similar to the Radiance renderings as a consequence, and we
would be interested to compare results to other rendering techniques
if you have them.

Please do not use this model for any purpose without giving proper credit.
