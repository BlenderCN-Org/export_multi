export_multi
============

Use the multi-exporter for Blender and check in (and tweak) various
scenes step by step.

See [Bitbucket
repository](https://bitbucket.org/wahn/blender-add-ons/wiki/Home) for
the source code of the multi-exporter add-on.

Because scenes and textures are getting bigger and bigger I commit
only patches, iamges, and small files to the repository. To download a
scene for a specific renderer, please go to the
[download](https://www.janwalter.org/download) section of my private
web site ...
