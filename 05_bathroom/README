		Creston Bathroom Model

			by Greg Ward

This model was created as part of a bathroom rennovation project that
proved once and for all that computer modeling is a good way to avoid
doing any real work.  Please do not lift the toilet lid, as I
never got around to cleaning the bowl.

The Makefile may be used to build the various octrees by the different
rad input files (.rif suffix).  They are:

	blue_day.rif		- (not used) blue materials, daytime
	blue_night.rif		- (not used) blue materials, nighttime
	orig_day.rif		- pre-rennovation materials, daytime
	orig_night.rif		- pre-rennovation materials, nighttime
	rose_day.rif		- post-rennovation materials, daytime
	rose_night.rif		- post-rennovation materials, nighttime
	simple.rif		- simple (untextured) materials

To generate an interactive rendering of the sink for the original nighttime
bathroom model (for example), type:

	% make orig_night.oct
	% rad -o x11 orig_night.rif &
